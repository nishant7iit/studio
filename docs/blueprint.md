# **App Name**: API Sandbox

## Core Features:

- API Request Builder: Craft and send API requests (GET, POST, etc.) with custom headers, parameters, and body.
- Response Viewer: View formatted API responses with status codes, headers, and response times.
- Mock Server: Create frontend-only mock API endpoints with custom responses, supporting dynamic data with tools like Faker.js.  Responses should be switchable with live endpoints.
- API Collections & History: Organize API requests into collections and folders.  Track request history for quick reuse, plus import and export.
- API Documentation: Auto-generate API documentation (like Swagger) from requests with Markdown support for detailed notes.
- Environment Variables: Define and manage environment variables (base URLs, tokens) for different environments with a global scope and switch to various other variables
- Code Generation: Use an AI tool to automatically generate code snippets for requests using fetch, axios, cURL, etc.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong, clean blue (#29ABE2) for reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a professional, clean look.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFB347) to highlight calls to action and key functionality.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear readability and a modern look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for easy-to-read code snippets and API requests/responses.
- Use simple, consistent icons from a library like Material Icons or Font Awesome for clarity and easy recognition.
- Employ a tabbed interface with clear, structured sections for each function (Request Builder, Response Viewer, Mock Server, etc.).
